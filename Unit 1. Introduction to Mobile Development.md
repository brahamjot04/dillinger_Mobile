### **4. Seven Rules for Developing a Mobile Strategy**

-  Rule #1: Forget What You Think You Know
-  Rule #2: Believe What You See, Not What You Read
-  Rule #3: Constraints Never Come First
-  Rule #4: Focus on Context, Goals, and Needs
-  Rule #5: You Can’t Support Everything
-  Rule #6: Don’t Convert, Create
-  Rule #7: Keep It Simple

### Rule #1: Forget What You Think You Know
###### **Analogy: Learning to Bake a Cake 🎂**  

Imagine you've been baking cakes using the same old family recipe for years. It worked perfectly in your old kitchen with your old oven. Everyone loved it, and you believed it was the best way to bake a cake.  

Now, you enter a **new kitchen** with a modern oven, new ingredients, and different preferences. You assume your old recipe will work just as well here. But when you bake the cake, it doesn’t rise properly, the texture feels off, and people don’t seem to enjoy it as much. Why? Because you were relying on old knowledge instead of adapting to the **new environment.**  

##### **How Does This Relate to Mobile Development?**  
The mobile industry is constantly evolving. New tools, technologies, and user preferences emerge all the time. If you enter mobile development with outdated or incorrect assumptions, **you might be following an old recipe that no longer works.**  

##### **What Should You Do?**  
1. **Forget your old recipe** – Just because something worked in the past doesn’t mean it will work today. Mobile technology changes rapidly.  
2. **Don’t copy someone else’s cake** – A cake that works for one person may not suit another’s taste. Similarly, don’t blindly copy what others have done—focus on what your users need.  
3. **Start fresh** – Even if your mobile project has been running for a while, take a step back. Look at it with fresh eyes, experiment, and adjust based on the latest trends and user needs.  

By **letting go of outdated assumptions and embracing new possibilities**, you'll create something fresh, valuable, and suited to the modern world—just like baking the perfect cake for today’s audience! 🎂📱

### Rule #2: Believe What You See, Not What You Read
###### **Analogy: Taste the Cake, Don’t Just Read the Recipe 🎂**  

Imagine you find a cake recipe online that claims to be "the best chocolate cake ever." The reviews sound amazing, and the pictures look delicious. Without actually baking or tasting the cake yourself, you believe it must be great.  

But when you finally try the recipe, the cake turns out dry and tasteless. Why? Because **you trusted what you read instead of testing it yourself.**  

##### **How Does This Relate to Mobile Development?**  
In mobile, there are countless reports, trends, and so-called "expert opinions" about what works and what doesn’t. But just because something is written down doesn’t mean it’s true or applicable to your situation. **The only way to know what works is to test, observe, and learn from real users.**  

##### **Lessons from Cake Baking & Mobile Development:**  
1. **Don’t trust every recipe blindly** – Just like baking, mobile development requires testing. What worked last year may not work today. Trends change fast.  
2. **Ask people what they actually like** – Instead of assuming a cake (or an app) is great based on theory, **ask real users what they want** and observe their preferences.  
3. **Taste the cake yourself** – Before launching an app, use it in real scenarios, get feedback, and see how people interact with it.  
4. **Don’t be afraid to experiment** – Innovation comes from trying new things. Just like a baker tweaks recipes to improve taste, developers should adapt based on user behavior.  
5. **Have a backup plan** – If a cake turns out bad, you can repurpose it into cake pops. Similarly, if an app doesn’t succeed as expected, learn from it and pivot to something new.  

##### **Final Thought:**  
Instead of trusting everything you read, **go into the kitchen, bake the cake, and taste it yourself!** 📱🍰

### Rule #3: Constraints Never Come First 

##### **Analogy: Bake the Perfect Cake, Don’t Worry About the Oven Yet 🎂**  

Imagine you want to bake **the ultimate cake**—a rich, multi-layered chocolate masterpiece with creamy frosting and fresh strawberries on top. You’re excited about the idea and start planning.  

But then someone interrupts:  

🔹 **"You can’t make a multi-layered cake! Your oven is too small."**  
🔹 **"Strawberries? They might not be available all year."**  
🔹 **"Chocolate frosting? It could melt in hot weather!"**  

Before you even start mixing the batter, you’re forced to simplify. Instead of your dream cake, you end up with a plain cupcake—just because someone **focused on limitations too soon.**  

##### **How Does This Relate to Mobile Strategy?**  
When planning a mobile project, **starting with constraints is like worrying about your oven before you even have a recipe.** If you begin by thinking about device limitations, network issues, or budget constraints, you might never create something truly innovative.  

##### **Lessons from Cake Baking & Mobile Strategy:**  
1. **Design the cake first, worry about the oven later** – Focus on **what users want** (the delicious cake), not on technical hurdles (the oven’s size).  
2. **Ignore the "bad bakers" in the room** – There’s always someone who says, **"This won’t work because…."** Keep them out of the kitchen during brainstorming.  
3. **Every cake has baking challenges** – Ovens vary, ingredients might be unavailable, but **great bakers find creative solutions instead of giving up.**  
4. **Sell the dream cake before solving the details** – If people see the vision (a delicious cake), they’ll be more open to helping figure out how to bake it.  
5. **Be flexible, but don’t settle for a plain cake** – If one ingredient is unavailable, **find an alternative without ruining the entire recipe.**  

##### **Final Thought:**  
Great bakers **don’t let a small oven stop them from creating a masterpiece.** The same applies to mobile projects—**dream big, bake first, and solve problems as they come!** 🎂📱🚀

### Rule #4: Focus on Context, Goals, and Needs 

Let’s take **cake** as an example to illustrate **context, goals, and needs** in a mobile strategy!

##### **1. Start with Needs:**
Everyone has a basic need to **eat** (or **satisfy a sweet tooth** in this case). People might also need cake for specific reasons, like a birthday, a celebration, or even just to enjoy a treat after a long day.

##### Example:
- **Need**: People want something sweet or a cake to celebrate a special event like a birthday.

##### **2. Understand Goals:**
Now that we know the basic need (eating cake), we need to understand the **goal** behind it. What’s the customer trying to achieve with that cake? Do they want to make it themselves? Do they want a special flavor or type of cake? The goal might also depend on the person’s dietary preferences or restrictions.

##### Example:
- **Goal**: 
  - A person wants to **order a chocolate cake** for their birthday.
  - Someone else might want to **bake a healthy cake** that fits their diet.
  - A person could be looking to **find a cake shop near them** because they’re celebrating an event and need it quickly.

##### **3. Context:**
Context is all about the **variables** that impact the user’s goal. Where is the person? Are they at home or at a party? Do they have time to bake, or do they need it delivered fast? Context adds real-time details that help shape the experience.

##### Example:
- **Context**: 
  - A person might be **at home** and craving a chocolate cake.
  - Another person could be at a **birthday party** with a cake already, but they need **another cake** because it’s not enough for everyone.
  - Someone else could be **on the go** and needs to find a nearby bakery that’s open late.

##### **How to Build a Cake Strategy:**

1. **User’s Context**: 
   - The app could have an option for people who are **nearby** certain cake shops based on **location** or **time of day** (for those craving a late-night treat).
   
2. **User’s Goals**:
   - A customer can filter cakes based on goals: whether it’s for a **birthday cake**, a **healthy cake**, or a **specific flavor** (chocolate, vanilla, gluten-free, etc.).
   
3. **User’s Needs**:
   - The app could **suggest cake recipes** for users who want to **bake a cake at home**, or it could help them find the **perfect bakery** or **cake delivery service** for people who are **celebrating a special occasion**.

By focusing on **needs**, then refining those needs into **goals** and adding the **context** (location, time, occasion), you can design a cake strategy that helps users have the best experience, whether they’re ordering a cake or baking one themselves! 🍰📱

### Rule #5: You Can’t Support Everything 
When building a mobile strategy, one of the first things you have to do is **accept that you can't support every device** out there. The sheer number of mobile devices and browsers in the world makes it impractical to develop for each one, and trying to do so can drain your resources before you even get your product to market.

### **Focus on What Matters Most:**
The key is **targeting the right devices**, not just the most popular ones. You should prioritize devices that fit your **core user base** and the goals of your app or service.

#### Example (using **Cake** again):
Imagine you’re building a **cake delivery app**:
- If you’re targeting **business professionals**, you may want to ensure that your app works well on **iPhones** or **BlackBerrys** since they are more commonly used in that segment.
- If you’re targeting **families or stay-at-home parents**, they might use more **budget-friendly smartphones**, so you should consider **Android phones** with lower specs but good battery life.
- If your target market is **teenagers**, they might prefer social media integration and **smartphones with camera features**, so **mid-range Android phones** or **iPhones** may be ideal.

### **Steps for Effective Device Targeting:**
1. **Check Server Access Logs**: 
   - **Example**: Look at your current site traffic to see which devices are accessing your site. If you see lots of visits from Android devices, you may want to prioritize Android development.
   
2. **Understand Your User Base**: 
   - Visit an **operator store** to check which devices are recommended for your target audience. For example, if you’re building a fun, interactive cake-baking app for **creative individuals**, you may want to prioritize **iPhones** since that group tends to gravitate toward Apple products.

3. **Start Simple**:
   - Focus on a **core device set** based on your research. For example, if your app is used mostly by **busy professionals**, supporting devices like **iPhones** and **BlackBerrys** makes more sense. As you expand, you can add support for other devices.

### **Tips for Device Support:**
- **Don’t try to support every device**; start with the ones that most closely match your target audience’s needs.
- Sometimes, the **most popular device** isn’t the best choice for your app. For example, if your app involves complex video editing or baking tutorials, the user base may prefer devices that offer **better screen resolution** and **processing power** (like high-end **iPhones** or **Android phones**).
- **Check the devices already accessing your site** to understand the market demand.
  
By **focusing on the right devices** early on and refining your product from there, you can avoid wasting time and resources trying to accommodate every mobile device under the sun! 🎂📱

### Rule #6: Don’t Convert, Create 
When asked, “How do I convert my product to mobile?” the answer is simple: **you don’t**. Porting or converting a product directly from another medium (like a website) to mobile is not the best approach. Mobile has its unique set of challenges and advantages that require a fresh approach to product development.

##### **Why Converting Doesn’t Work:**
In the early days of web design, people tried to apply the principles of **print design** (like glossy brochures) to websites. The result? Slow loading times, cluttered designs, and text that was hard to read. It wasn’t until we realized that **web design needs its own approach** that the web evolved into what it is today. The same principle applies to mobile.

##### **The Right Approach: Create, Don’t Convert**
A great mobile product is **created specifically for the mobile medium**, not just shrunk down from a website or app designed for desktop use. Here’s how you can think about creating a mobile-friendly experience:

##### Example (using **Cake** again):
If you’re creating a **cake ordering app** for mobile, simply converting your **website’s cake catalog** to a small screen might not work well. Instead, think about how mobile users behave:
- **Context**: A user might be searching for cakes while on the go. They don’t want to waste time scrolling through a large catalog of cakes. Instead, they likely want quick access to **information like flavor, price, and availability**.
- **Create a Tailored Experience**: Instead of just displaying the same website content, you could build features that allow users to **quickly filter cakes by flavor, price range, or special dietary needs** and even see **real-time availability**. You could also add **location-based features** that show nearby cake shops or delivery options.

##### Key Tips for Creating Mobile-First Experiences:
1. **Understand Your User’s Context**:
   - Know **how and when** users will access your app. For instance, if a user is looking for a cake while in a store, the app should be able to provide **quick, easy-to-digest info** rather than forcing them to scroll.
   
2. **Embrace Mobile's Unique Benefits**:
   - Mobile devices are different from desktop computers. They’re more personal, **on-the-go**, and context-sensitive. Instead of simply applying desktop rules to mobile, **take advantage of mobile’s strengths**, like:
     - **Location awareness**: For a cake app, this could mean offering users the nearest bakery.
     - **Instant access**: Mobile allows for quicker decision-making, so don’t overwhelm users with too many choices or too much information.

### Rule #7: Keep It Simple
If there’s one rule to remember in mobile product design, it’s **keep it simple**. While mobile devices are powerful, people don’t want them to be overly complicated. Users want apps that are straightforward and meet their basic needs—no more, no less. Here’s why simplicity is so important and how you can apply it:

##### **Why Simplicity Matters:**
Mobile devices are **intelligent**, but users are looking for **easy-to-use experiences**. They don’t need every feature from your desktop site or web app. They want **focused, simple solutions** that help them achieve specific tasks quickly. The goal is to **keep the experience easy**, intuitive, and efficient.

##### **Example (Cake App):**
In the context of your **cake ordering app**, don’t overwhelm users with **hundreds of cake varieties** or too many options. Focus on the key needs:
- Let users **search by flavor** or dietary needs (gluten-free, vegan).
- Offer **easy ordering** with options like delivery or pickup.
- Include basic features like **reviews**, **ratings**, and **real-time availability**—nothing more.
The goal is to make it easy for users to accomplish their task (order a cake) without distractions or unnecessary steps.

##### **Tips for Keeping It Simple:**
1. **Limit Features to What’s Most Important:**
   - Focus on the core features that address **your users’ needs**. Don’t overload your app with features that are not essential. Prioritize simplicity over complexity.
   
2. **Keep the User’s Interest Front and Center:**
   - Build your mobile experience **around the users’ needs**. Ask yourself: What is the main thing users will want to do? Design the app around that single goal.

3. **Avoid Feature Creep:**
   - It’s tempting to add features as you go, but each new feature should serve a **clear purpose**. Avoid adding things just because they sound cool or because of internal company goals. It’s about what **the user wants**.

4. **Learn and Iterate Quickly:**
   - Simple products are easier to test, gather feedback, and improve upon. A lean and simple app allows you to **iterate faster**, learn from users, and make changes more efficiently.
