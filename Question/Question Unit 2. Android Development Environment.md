   - *Answer*: Use a **Service** because it can run in the background and perform tasks like checking for new messages without needing a user interface.

5. **If you wanted to allow other apps to access your app's data, such as saved notes or contacts, which Android component would you implement?**
   - *Answer*: Use a **Content Provider** to safely manage and share your app's data with other apps.

6. **In your app, you have two screens—a list of items and a detailed view of an item when clicked. You want to reuse the list on multiple screens. Which component is best for this and why?**
   - *Answer*: Use a **Fragment** for the list because it is modular and can be reused in multiple screens, allowing a flexible UI design.

7. **You are developing an Android app where the user can add items to a shopping list. When a user rotates the device, how would you manage the activity life cycle to prevent data loss?**
   - *Answer*: Use the **onSaveInstanceState** and **onRestoreInstanceState** methods in the **Activity** life cycle to save and restore the user's data when the device rotates.

8. **If you want to start another screen in your app with some data, like an email app opening a compose screen with a draft, how would you do it?**
   - *Answer*: Use an **Intent** with extra data to start the new screen, such as using `intent.putExtra("message", "Draft message")` to pass the draft text.

9. **Your app displays a contact list, and you want it to access the user’s contacts stored on the phone. Which component and Android feature do you need to access this information?**
   - *Answer*: Use a **Content Provider** to access the contacts and request the **Contacts permission** in the **Android Manifest** file.

10. **What would happen if an app didn't declare a required permission in its Manifest but tried to access restricted data?**
    - *Answer*: The app would crash or throw a security exception, as Android checks that all necessary permissions are declared in the **Manifest** file before accessing restricted data.
